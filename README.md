Thanks to Roman he introduced me to scratch, I have no idea about it before. Scrach as its name shows, I found it easy to practice coding by scraching the codes. However, as of my understanding scrach is just only for beginners.
# I am inspired to create a website for non-political, non-religious,and not for profit commmuinity groups.
# I will do this all for free.
# This will help me to upgrade my skills in coding and moral satisfaction.

Coding on Python/Visual Studio seems to work for me. So I will proced with it.
# In meanwhile I will save all my coding in github.
#For this purpose I have been creating separate pages in github.
